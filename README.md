This repository contains a Haskell code example demonstrating a subtle bug related to creating a Monoid instance for the Maybe Int type. The bug manifests when the mappend function is used in certain situations where non-numeric values are unexpectedly handled.  The solution demonstrates a more robust approach, addressing the problem by handling the non-numeric edge case and resulting in cleaner code with better error handling.
